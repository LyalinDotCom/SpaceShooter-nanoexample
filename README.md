# Space Shooter

A simple and fun 2D space shooter game built with modern web technologies.

This project serves as a code sample to demonstrate how to build a simple game using Phaser 3 and Vite.

## Features

*   Endless waves of enemies with increasing difficulty.
*   20 different enemy ship sprites.
*   5 beautiful, rotating space backgrounds.
*   Player movement and shooting.
*   Score and wave tracking.

## Technology Stack

*   **Game Engine:** [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3)
*   **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
*   **Language:** JavaScript (ESM)
*   **Image Generation:** This game's assets were created with a generative AI model.

## How to Play

*   **Move:** Use the `Left` and `Right` arrow keys to move your ship.
*   **Shoot:** Press the `Spacebar` to fire your weapon.

## Local Development

To run the game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd smallgame-nano-2
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build for Production

To build the game for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `public` directory containing the optimized and bundled game files, ready for deployment to a static web host like Firebase Hosting.
